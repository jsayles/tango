This client implementation is built on Circuit Python 2.3.1 but due to the fact
that the sensor lib does not expose calibration data and that circuitpython does
not yet support interupts (for the buttons), I reluctantly switched to arduino. 
I'm leaving this here in hopes I can switch back to python when it's ready.  --JLS
