# Tango Sentio
Tango Sentio is a 3D Scanner Glove using the Bosch BNO055 Absolute Orientation 9-DOF sensor.

## The Name
From Latin tango: touching, and sentio: seeing.  No we don't speak Latin but we have google and it sounded cool.

## Hardware
 - Sensor:  [Adafruit 9-DOF Absolute Orientation - BNO055] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2472)
 - Controller:  [Adafruit Feather M0 Express] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403)

## Client
The client runs on the micro controller to handle button events and communicate
the sensor data via serial (115200).  

## Server
The "server" is a python script that runs on your computer and reads the incoming
data from the client.

## Calibration

The sensor outputs calibration data for the gyroscope, accelerometer,
magnetometer, and the system as a whole in a range of 0 to 3.  When the device
starts up the LED will be red.  Watch the serial port for the calibration data,
and move the device through the calibration steps until all values are 3.  The
LED will turn green when this is complete.

### Steps
- **Gyroscope:** Leave flat on the table for a couple seconds.
- **Accelerometer:** Rotate across one axis in 45Ëš intervals.
- **Magnetometer:** Hold vertically up, and then down.

For a more elaborate explanation of calibration you can watch the
[Bosch Training Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw0WuAyGsnY). The
configuration is in NDoF_FMC_On mode so the important part is at the end of the
video.
